# Frontend Engineering Assignment

### Overview

The goal of this assignment is to:

1. Assess your ability to create pixel-perfect frontend UI experience from a Figma mockup

2. Evaluate the quality and efficiency of your frontend code

### Instructions

Create a production ready version of [this UI mockup](https://www.figma.com/file/kIuMI4fBxEUIfrylsnV50o/Athlete-Studio---Frontend-Developer-Assignment?node-id=0%3A1)

**Follow these guidelines:**

1. Create a project locally with either:
    * static html, css and js
    * or the javascript framework of your choice (i.e. React, Vue)

2. Use the provided `athlete.json` file, containing the 16 athletes' data to populate each card.

3. Use either SASS or LESS as your css pre-processor. You can use an external css library (for example, Tailwind) but only for grid and spacing.

4. Create Mixins for the `<button>` and `<input>` styles.

5. Add sorting functionality to the "Sort By" input so the cards can be sorted by Oldest and Newest. Use the `drop_date` field to order the JSON by date.

6. Only show the first 12 athlete cards by default. Display the remaining 4 when the "Load More Athletes" button is clicked.

7. Make the UI responsive on mobile screens (< 400px wide) by collapsing into rows of 2 at the mobile breakpoint.

### Closing

All project files should be delivered via Github within 72 hours of receiving the assignment with instructions to run the application locally. Best of luck!
